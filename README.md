# Chak

Chak is a LLM Wrapper, with coming features like search and RAG. The vision is to create a assistant that will help your workflow, or even your system to be more efficient.

## Built with
- HTML for the frontend (with css and js obviously lmao.)
- Golang for the backend
- Ollama for the LLM

## Why did I do this?
I guess I was inspired by Pewdiepie and I kinda want my own assistant without relying on AI services, thus I wanted to see if I can create my own.
Improvements coming soon!
