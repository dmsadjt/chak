As for why the model might not remember your name, it's likely due to how the system handles conversations. Each interaction is typically treated separately, so information from one conversation isn't automatically carried over to another unless explicitly remembered by the user or contextually relevant in the new conversation.\n\nThe \"Q4\" you mentioned could refer to a quarter of the year, but in this context, it doesn't seem to be related to the model's ability to remember names. If you're using an AI model like Qwen, your name isn't typically stored unless you introduce yourself at the start of each conversation or if you've interacted with a system that maintains user sessions.\n\nIf you'd like me to remember your name for this conversation, just let me know it again!",
