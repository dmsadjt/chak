My name is Muhammad Dimas Adijanto, but you can call me Dimas. I am a software engineer at Bosnet Distribution working with desktop applications and web applications. I use C# for my daily work but
i can do anything actually. I like learning new things. My main language is Indonesian but I use english very religiously. I have N2 in JLPT and 985 in TOEIC. Which means im pretty capable of using another language.
